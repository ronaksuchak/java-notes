Island of Isolation in Java


Object 1 references Object 2 and Object 2 references Object 1. Neither Object 1 nor Object 2 is referenced by any other object. That’s an island of isolation.

An island of isolation is a group of objects that reference each other but they are not referenced by any active object in the application. 

Even a single unreferenced object is an island of isolation too.

Eg: Solve this !


public class Test 
{ 
    Test i; 
    public static void main(String[] args)   
    { 
        Test t1 = new Test(); 
        Test t2 = new Test(); 
            
        t1.i = t2; 
        t2.i = t1; 
           
        
        t1 = null; //how many candidates for GC ?
        // requesting GC
        System.gc(); 
        System.out.println("after 1st GC");
         
        t2 = null; //how many candidates for GC ?
          
        // requesting GC
        System.gc(); 
        System.out.println("after 2nd GC");
         
    } 
  
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable  
    {  
        System.out.println("Finalize method called");  
    } 
} 
What will be o/p?
