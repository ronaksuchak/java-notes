Regarding garbage collection
Garbage= un -referencable object.

Automatic Gargabe Collection --- to avoid memory leaks/holes

JVM creates 2 thrds --- main thrd(to exec main() sequentially) -- foreground thrd
G.C --- daemon thrd ---background thrd --- JVM activates it periodically(only if required)  --- GC releases the memory occupied by un-referenced objects allocated on the heap(the obj whose no. of ref=0) 

How to request for GC ?
API of System class
public static void gc()

Object class API
protected void finalize() throws Throwable
Automatically called by the garbage collector on an object before garbage collection of the object takes place.


Releasing of  non- Java resources.(eg - closing of DB connection, closing file handles,closing socket connections)   is NOT done automatically by GC

Triggers for marking the object for GC(candidate for GC)

1. Nullifying all valid refs.
eg : Box b1=new Box(...);
BOx b2=b1;
b1=b2=null;
2. re-assigning the reference to another object
eg : Box b1=new Box(1,2,3);
b1=new Box(1,2,3);// 1st obj is marked for GC
3. Object created within a method & its ref NOT returned to the caller.
4. Island of isolation
