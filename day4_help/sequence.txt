What's a package ?
Why Packges ?
If u don't add a pkg stmt ?
Classes will by def added under anonymous pkg
syntax
1. 1st stmt : 
package com.app.geometry;
public class Point2D {...}

2. packgaes ---folders
<day4>/src
javac -d ..\bin com\app\tester\TestPoint.java

<day4>/bin
java com.app.tester.TestPoint
3. CLASSPATH 
java specific env var
who -- JVM's class loader
which purpose --to locate java classes --load
what --- top of pkged hierarchy




1.  Array handling
refer -- Java Tut slides No  29
In Java, arrays are full-fledged objects. Like objects, arrays are dynamically created & stored on the heap. 

Arrays (like any other object) are  associated with the class. All arrays of the same dimension and type have the same class. The length of an array does not play any role in establishing the array's class. For example, an array of three ints has the same class as an array of three hundred ints.([I) The length of an array is considered part of its instance data.

eg : The class name for single dimension array of ints is "[I". The class name for a three-dimensional array of bytes is "[[[B". The class name for single dimension array of booleans is "[Z"

Array size(length) is fixed.Implicit super class of array is java.lang.Object.



1.1 Create Array of primitive types

Objective -- Accept no of data samples(of type double) from User(using scanner)
Create suitable array & display it using for-loop , to confirm default values.

Accept data from User(scanner) & store it in the array.
Display array data from for loop.
eg : double[] data=new double[10];
//display all elems of the array : for-each loop
for-each loop(enhanced for loop)
syntax
for(double d : data) //d=data[0],d=data[1],......d=data[data.length-1]
 sop(d);

Works on a copy.
Solve example
Limitations of for-each
1. Since it works on a copy : can't be used to modify array data
2. Always iterates from 1st elem till last elem , with step size = +1

API --java.util.Arrays : helper class for array handling
Method 
public static String toString(double[] a)
Returns a string representation of the contents of the specified array.
-----------------
1.2 Array of references
Objective : Ask user(client) , how many boxes to make ?
Prompt for Box dims , for each box.
Store these details suitably.
1. Display using single for-each loop, box dims n volume

eg : sop("How many boxes?");//10
Box[] boxes=new Box[sc.nextInt()];//how many objs are created on heap ? 1 : 
//which class M.A : [Lcom.app.core.Box

2. Double box width for all boxes having volume > 100.(USE for-each & solve this)

for-each limitations
1. Can only iterate from 1st elem to last elem , with step size +1
2. Works on a copy of array elems
(can't be used for modifying array elems).
